CS 351 Code Repository
----------------------

This repository contains starter code for all the machine problems you'll be
working on in this class. It is a private, shared repository, to which only you
and the instructor/TAs have access. 

We encourage you to commit your work early and often, and to use meaningful
(albeit short) commit messages. Remember that the only changes we will see,
however, are those that you actually push to the repository hosted on GitHub.
Please make sure you know how to do this! You can always confirm what commits
you successfully pushed by checking out your repository page on GitHub.

After cloning this repository, you should fill in your name and e-mail below.

By doing so, you pledge on your honor that you will neither give nor receive any
unauthorized assistance on the machine problems contained in this repository.
